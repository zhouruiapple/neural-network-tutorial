Introduction
 
I have been interested in artificial intelligence and artificial life for years and I read most of the popular books printed on the subject. I developed a grasp of most of the topics yet neural networks always seemed to elude me. Sure, I could explain their architecture but as to how they actually worked and how they were implemented… well that was a complete mystery to me, as much magic as science. I bought several books on the subject but every single one attacked the subject from a very mathematical and academic viewpoint and very few even gave any practical uses or examples. So for a long long time I scratched my head and hoped that one day I would be able to understand enough to experiment with them myself.
 
That day arrived some time later when - sat in a tent in the highlands of Scotland reading a book - I had a sudden blast of insight. It was one of those fantastic “eureka” moments and although Scotland is a beautiful place I couldn’t wait to get to a computer so I could try out what I’d just learnt. To my surprise the first neural net I programmed worked perfectly and I haven’t looked back since. I still have a great deal to learn, neural nets are a huge subject, but I hope I can share enough knowledge and enthusiasm to get you started on your own little projects. In many ways the fields of AI and A-Life are very exciting to work in. I think of these subjects as the explorers of old must have looked at all those vast empty spaces on the maps. There is so much to learn and discover.
